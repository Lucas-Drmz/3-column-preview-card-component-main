## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass preprocessor
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Realising this challenge was an opportunity for me to practice my skills with Sass preprocessor.
The bigger challenge I got to face was to properly center the items on the page, and it was a good training to play around 
with flexbox properties to manage a satisfying result in the end.

### Continued development

It would be good to take up another challenge with similar requirements so that I could practice and further develop my skills on
technologies used for this project.
